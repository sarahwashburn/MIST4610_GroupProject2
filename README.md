# Describing the Data
The dataset shows leading death causes in the United States for each year plus each state. It contains over 10,000 entries with cause of death, death count along with age-adjusted death rate. Each row contains data for a specific cause in a specific year and place. It includes every state besides overall national figures. Because it considers age differences, the age-adjusted death rate helps people make reasonable comparisons between states. The dataset lacks missing information, so it is simple to use. It is good to spot trends and analyze public health changes through time. From this project in particular, we answered questions such as, "What states saw the biggest rise in suicide deaths over time?" also "What states now have the highest cancer age-adjusted death rates?" These inquiries help determine areas where health issues grow and identify focus points.
