# Describing the Data: Leading Causes of Death in the U.S. from 1999-2017 (National Center for Health Statistics)
The dataset shows leading death causes in the United States for each year plus each state. It contains over 10,000 entries with cause of death, death count along with age-adjusted death rate. Each row contains data for a specific cause in a specific year and place. It includes every state besides overall national figures. Because it considers age differences, the age-adjusted death rate helps people make reasonable comparisons between states. The dataset lacks missing information, so it is simple to use. It is good to spot trends and analyze public health changes through time. From this project in particular, we answered questions such as, "What states saw the biggest rise in suicide deaths over time?" also "What states now have the highest cancer age-adjusted death rates?" These questions are important because they can help point out where certain health issues are getting worse and where more attention or resources might be needed. Overall, the dataset is a valuable resource for studying trends in mortality and gaining insight into how public health challenges vary across the country.
